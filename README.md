# Project_Planner

## Purpose:
This is a full stack web app I made to get practice with Javascript, Node, Express, CSS Bootstrap, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, and some other tools. It is a CRUD app, which allows users to create accounts and task items. These tasks items can have details added to them allowing for users to create a primitive project board and to do lists. Users cannot edit tasks created by other users, but may view them.
