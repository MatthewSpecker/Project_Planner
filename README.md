# Project_Planner

## Purpose:
This is a full stack CRUD web app I made to get practice with Javascript, Node, Express, CSS Bootstrap, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, and some other tools. It allows users to create accounts and task items. These task items can have details added to them allowing for users to create a primitive project board and to do lists. Users cannot edit tasks created by other users, but may view them.
